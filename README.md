# Matchies

Project numero uno! Our first project will touch on all the bases we've covered so far; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is called concentration. Essentially, a matching game, a really simple premise that allowed enough freedom for aggressive ingenuity! Pay attention though!

## Approaches Taken

* Animations are utilized whenever a card is flipped
* All game cards are created dynamically for ease and for shock and awe
* All game logic is implemented through class methods
* setTimeout statements are utilized throughout to give the appearance of automation
